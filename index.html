      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <p>
        After completing MBA, I started my career as a Management trainee. I
        worked in a different company.My role was mostly developing and building
        business. Generating new clients.I worked 4 years as business developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, I wanted to enhance my career and pursue digital marketing
        course from Digital Vidya for 6 months. Then I started my career as a
        digtal marketer with a company called cubicost. But I wanted to do
        something for me. So, I left job and started working as a freelancer. I
        started writing my blog, worked as a ghost writer, wrote few articles
        and managed different social media accounts of my clients.
      </p>
      <p>
        I then developed interest in coding. So, I thought why not come out of
        my comfort zone and starts learning coding. I opted few course on udemy
        and started learning coding. Meanwhile, I was also working on my blogs
        and writing for clients.
